# Introduction
I was finding it very tedious to go again and again on Naukri.com website and upload the CV manually, so finally I decided I should work out some automated way to upload the CV without having to do it manually all the time.
Hence, I created this code where You just need to provide the "UserName", "Password" and the "FilePath(your system path)", allowing system to login in to Naukri.com and upload the CV without any manual intervention.

A Config. properties file has been added in the test/resources folder, where you need to provide your email id, password and folder path, which system will pick on runtime and complete the process successfully.
